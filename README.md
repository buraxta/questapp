# QuestApp - Full Stack Web Application with Spring Boot and React

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to my journey of developing a full stack web application using Spring Boot and React, inspired by the QuestApp project. I am actively following the corresponding tutorial on Dilruba KÃ¶se's YouTube channel. This README provides an overview of my motivation, background, and the steps to run the application.

## Why This Project?

As a dedicated learner in the field of software development, I have completed comprehensive courses on both Spring Boot and React. Now, I am excited to apply my theoretical knowledge into practical experience by working on a real-world project like QuestApp, guided by the tutorials on Dilruba KÃ¶se's YouTube channel.

## Project Overview

QuestApp is designed to be a full stack web application that allows users to create, track, and manage quests or tasks. It incorporates the powerful backend capabilities of Spring Boot for robust API development and the dynamic frontend interfaces created with React for an engaging user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Spring Boot
- **Frontend:** React

## Learning Goals

My main learning goals with this project include:

- **Hands-On Experience:** Gain practical, hands-on experience in building a full stack web application.
- **Integration of Spring Boot and React:** Learn how to seamlessly integrate Spring Boot with React for a cohesive and efficient development workflow.
- **Database Interaction:** Implement data persistence by working with databases on the backend.
- **UI/UX Design:** Improve frontend skills by creating a clean and user-friendly interface.
